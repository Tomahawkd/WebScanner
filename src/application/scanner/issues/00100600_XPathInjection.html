<h1>Issue name</h1>
XPath injection
<h1>Typical severity</h1>

High

<h1>Issue description</h1>
 
<p>XPath injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is incorporated into XPath queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.</p>
<p>Depending on the purpose for which the vulnerable query is being used, an attacker may be able to exploit an XPath injection flaw to read sensitive application data or interfere with application logic. </p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>User input should be strictly validated before being 
  incorporated into XPath queries. 
  In most cases, it will be appropriate to accept input containing only short 
  alphanumeric strings. At the very least, input containing any XPath metacharacters 
  such as " ' / @ = * [ ] ( and ) should be rejected.</p>
