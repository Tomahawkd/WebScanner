User agent-dependent response
<h1>Typical severity</h1>

Information

<h1>Issue description</h1>

<p>Application responses may depend systematically on the value of the User-Agent header in requests. This behavior does not itself constitute a security vulnerability, but may point towards additional attack surface within the application, which may contain vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This behavior often arises because applications provide different user interfaces for desktop and mobile users. Mobile interfaces have often been less thoroughly tested for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, and often have simpler authentication and session handling mechanisms that may contain problems that are not present in the full interface.</p>
<p>To review the interface provided by the alternate User-Agent header, you can configure a match/replace rule in Burp Proxy to modify the User-Agent header in all requests, and then browse the application in the normal way using your normal browser. </p>
