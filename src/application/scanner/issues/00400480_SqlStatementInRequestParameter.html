SQL statement in request parameter
<h1>Typical severity</h1>

Medium

<h1>Issue description</h1>

<p>HTTP requests sometimes contain SQL syntax. If this is incorporated into a SQL query and executed by the server, then the application is almost certainly vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<p>When SQL-like syntax is observed, you should verify whether the request contains a genuine SQL query and whether this is being executed by the server. </p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>Applications should not incorporate any user-controllable data directly into SQL queries. Parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) should be used to safely insert data into predefined queries. In no circumstances should users be able to control or modify the structure of the SQL query itself.</p>
