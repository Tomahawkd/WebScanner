<h1>Issue name</h1>
Cross-origin resource sharing: arbitrary origin trusted
<h1>Typical severity</h1>
High
<h1>Issue description</h1><p>An HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy controls whether and how content running on other domains can perform two-way interaction with the domain that publishes the policy. The policy is fine-grained and can apply access controls per-request based on the URL and other features of the request.</p><p>
Trusting arbitrary origins effectively disables the same-origin policy, allowing two-way interaction by third-party web sites. Unless the response consists only of unprotected public content, this policy is likely to present a security risk.</p>
<p>If the site  specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to  bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users'  browsers.</p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>Rather than using a wildcard or programatically verifying supplied origins, use a whitelist of trusted domains.</p>
